# Deploy MK2/MK3 Protocol Fix to Remote Server

echo "=== Deploying RedRat MK2/MK3 Protocol Fix ==="
echo

echo "1. Push changes to GitHub:"
echo "   git push origin main"
echo

echo "2. SSH to your remote server and run:"
echo "   ssh your-remote-server"
echo "   cd /path/to/redrat-proxy"
echo "   git pull origin main"
echo "   docker-compose restart"
echo

echo "3. Monitor logs for protocol override:"
echo "   docker-compose logs -f | grep -i 'protocol override'"
echo

echo "4. Test IR transmission and look for these log messages:"
echo "   - 'Device detected as MK2, but forcing MK3+ SYNC protocol'"
echo "   - 'Protocol override: Using MK3+ SYNC mode'"
echo "   - 'Forced MK3+ SYNC IR signal sent successfully'"
echo

echo "5. Capture new packets to verify ~80% reduction in packet count"
echo

echo "Expected Results:"
echo "✅ Single OUTPUT_IR_SYNC message instead of 5-6 messages"
echo "✅ ~80% fewer packets (from 4.8x to 1x compared to official tool)"
echo "✅ Same IR functionality with better efficiency"

# If you want to run this automatically:
if [[ "$1" == "--deploy" ]]; then
    echo "Pushing to GitHub..."
    git push origin main
    
    echo "Changes pushed! Now SSH to your remote server and run:"
    echo "  git pull origin main && docker-compose restart"
