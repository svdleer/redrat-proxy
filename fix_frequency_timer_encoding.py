"""
Fix frequency encoding in redrat_service.py according to RedRat specs.

According to the RedRat IRNetBox documentation (section 5.2.8.2):
The timer producing the modulation/carrier frequency switching runs at 6MHz, so converting 
a required frequency value in Hz (e.g. 38000Hz), the following equation is used:

timer_value = 65536 - (6MHz / carrier_freq_in_Hz)

As the timer_value is an up-counting re-load value, we subtract it from 65536 to give 
the correct timer count to overflow.

The current code incorrectly encodes the raw frequency value instead of the timer value.
